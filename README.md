# 6502
<h1>6502 emulation</h1>

Right now a fully functional NMOS 6502 (with non BCD variants).

Also a fully emulated PIA 6532 RIOT chip.

TIA emulation is in progress to eventually create an atari 2600 emulator
for both playing games and being used as a platform for machine learning.

Also some misc utilities developed along the way (disassembler, c64 basic,
quick and dirty hand assembler helper).

Random semi-coherent thoughts on this development at https://maker-rambling.blogspot.com/
